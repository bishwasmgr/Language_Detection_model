# Language Detection Model (Text Classification)
This project is a Language Detection Model built using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment (Anaconda). The model is trained to detect the language of a given text input using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning classifiers.

# Features
Detects language from raw text input (short or long)

Supports 22 languages including English, French, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Urdu, and more

Preprocessing with CountVectorizer to convert text into numerical format

Trained using popular ML algorithms (e.g., Multinomial Naive Bayes)

Achieves high accuracy on test data

Built and tested in Anaconda Jupyter Notebook

Simple, clean, and beginner-friendly implementation

# Tech Stack
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda)

scikit-learn

NumPy

Pandas

# How It Works
Load and preprocess dataset (text samples + language labels)

Convert text to feature vectors using CountVectorizer

Split dataset into training and testing sets

Train a classification model (e.g., Naive Bayes)

Evaluate model performance on unseen data

Predict language from new input text
